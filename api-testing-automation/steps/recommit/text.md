## Finalize and Commit Changes

After fixing the error in the API, let's try to **commit** the changes again. First, **add all changes** in the current directory to the **staging area** before the commit.

`git add .`{{exec}}

Then, **commit** them with a message indicating that we have **fixed** the `ZeroDivisionError`:

`git commit -m "Fix ZeroDivisionError in GET /divide"`{{exec}}

The **pre-commit hook** will **automatically** run **all of the tests** again to ensure that the changes **do not** introduce any **new errors**. 

## Verification with Git

Now that all tests should pass, the commit should be successfully added. Let's verify it by running:

`git log`{{exec}}

The **result** should now contain your **latest commit**, confirming that the changes have been **successfully recorded** in the **repository**.
